- 👋 Hi, I’m @RandyIsBack2It
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new coding languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing, though that will hopefully change sooner than later.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can improve the quality of life for those with mental illness - though I am not quite sure what.
- 📫 How to reach me: Unknown - does git have a messenging system?
